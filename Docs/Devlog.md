# Logbook

Welcome to my logbook. This is mostly a place for venting and reflecting on the problems I’ve run into: how I solved them, and maybe a bit of random rambling here and there.

It’s mainly for myself, but feel free to take a peek into my frustrations!

## Thought process (25/09)

- Honestly, I didn’t know where to begin or what to use—what language, which tools, etc. This was really frustrating and, to be fair, quite a reality check.

- After making the first part of the map, I realized I tend to get too perfectionistic about the smallest details. I’ll have to avoid this, otherwise I’ll still be working on it next year…

- The concept of working with layers wasn’t hard, and I picked it up quickly. Still, things got messy pretty fast, so I had to spend some time reorganizing them.

- Accidentally working in the wrong layer is definitely a new frustration I wouldn’t recommend. It’s not a huge effort to fix, but still pretty annoying.

- And i could definitly use a better Laptop...
