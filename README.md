Hello World

(The name is still a work in progress)

This is going to be a choice-based adventure game focused on interactive storytelling with multiple paths and endings.
Exploration mechanics will be included to add immersion, but the story is the core experience.

## Features (Planned)

    Choice-driven story with multiple paths and endings

    Exploration system inspired by classic RPG movement

    AI-driven dialogue: players can type their own input and get dynamic responses (just a few though)

    Data persistence: save progress and decisions

    Monetization elements: optional ad-free version and hint purchases for secret content

    Available as both an app and a web game

## Goals

    Build a fun, replayable choice-based game

    Experiment with AI and data handling in games

    Showcase skills in development, design, and security best practices

    Showcase creativity in storytelling

    Create a project I can present and be proud of
